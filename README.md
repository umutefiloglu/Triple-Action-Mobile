Here is my comprehensive template project prioritizing development works. Any additions/opinions are welcomed.
Key Points:

- UML-Like diagram prepared and edited.
- Singleton, Strategy, Observer patterns are used.
- Less coupling is achieved with minimal inheritance.
- Genetic Algorithm, Travelling Salesman Problem, Minimum Spanning Tree are some algorithmic subjects that are researched through the project.
- Editor is extended through serialization and modification (like read-only properties).
- Three different hyper-casual game mechanics (Resizing, Maze, Growing/Shrinking) are implemented in the game.
- Approximate duration to complete project: 5-6 days.
